## Problem Statement Addressed

"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?

## Project Overview

Our solution tackles two major problems:

Households often miss plastic collection opportunities due to a lack of real-time information about when collectors arrive.

People lack motivation to reduce plastic usage because there's no direct reward for doing so.

We propose a web-based platform that provides real-time schedules for plastic collection in local areas, ensuring that residents never miss a chance to contribute. In addition, the platform encourages sustainable behavior by rewarding users with points whenever they log activities like avoiding plastic use or adopting eco-friendly alternatives. These points can be redeemed for eco-friendly gifts such as paper bags, cloth bags, or other sustainable items.

This system benefits:

Residents, by making plastic contribution easy and rewarding.

Collectors, by increasing participation and efficiency.

The environment, through reduced plastic use and proper waste disposal.

## Key Features

Live Plastic Collection Scheduler:
A dynamic calendar showing when plastic collectors will visit specific neighborhoods, so residents can prepare and never miss a collection.

Plastic Reduction Reward System:
Users log their eco-friendly actions (e.g., using paper bags, refusing plastic straws) and earn points.

Eco-Reward Store:
Accumulated points can be redeemed for sustainable gifts, encouraging long-term behavioral change toward plasticÂ reduction.
